First, I used the WITH clause to name the CTE ‘average_sum’ and added the columns in parentheses with AS used to enclose the query from task 8. After the query, I selected for all the 
columns in the WITH clause by using the average_sum named in step one. I then grouped by all the columns and ordered it by the average in descending order.
